    <p><strong>MANILA,Philippines</strong> - The measure seeking the regulation of vaporized
    nicotine (vape) and non-nicotine products as well as novel tobacco products - also known
    as the <em>"Vape Bill"</em> - has lapsed into law.
    The measure regulates the importation, manufacture, sale, packaging,
    distribution, use, and communication of vaporized nicotine or
    vape and non-nicotine products, including novel tobacco products.</p>
    
    <!--Editorial-->
    <p><i>"No man is an island,"</i>a well-known adage that people use to describe how we are all
    interconnected with one another. But the pandemic lockdowns posted a challenge to everyone'
    sense of community.
    Yet, the pandemic has also been the <u>best time to extend a helping hand to others</u> in the 
    practice of <strong>compassion and service</strong> in the same way that 
    <strong><i>Saint Loyola</i></strong> did.
    It also taught us to be closer to God through prayers and gave us a new purpose in life.
